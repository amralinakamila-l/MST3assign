## 3. Algorithm Efficiency Analysis

### 3.1. Time Complexity vs Actual Performance

**Theoretical Complexities:**
- **Prim**: O(E log V) with binary heap
- **Kruskal**: O(E log E) for sorting + O(E α(V)) for Union-Find

**Actual Performance Observations:**

### 3.2. Operation Efficiency Paradox

**Key Finding:** Prim uses 48.7% fewer operations but achieves worse time performance.

**Root Causes:**

2. **Java Runtime**: Optimized Collections.sort() vs PriorityQueue overhead
3. **Constant Factors**: Higher per-operation cost in Prim's implementation

**Operation-to-Time Efficiency:**
- **Prim**: 732.4 operations → 2.34ms (0.0032ms/operation)
- **Kruskal**: 1428.6 operations → 1.42ms (0.0010ms/operation)
